Using the classes
=================
1. Include all of the classes into your Xcode project.
2. Ideally, in your *Project*_Prefix.pch pre-compiled header file, include
   the following line:  
       \#import Convenience.h
3. All of the convenience classes, #define's, and category extensions are now
   available to you.
